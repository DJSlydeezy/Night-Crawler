In the UK, around 10 million people have arthritis. It affects people\u00a0of all ages, including children (see below). Types of arthritis The two most common types of arthritis are: osteoarthritis rheumatoid arthritis Osteoarthritis Osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis in the UK, affecting around 8 million people. It most often develops in\u00a0adults who are in their late 40s or older. It's also more common in women and\u00a0people with a family history of\u00a0the condition.\u00a0However, it can occur at any age as a result of an injury or be associated with other\u00a0joint-related conditions, such as gout or rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoarthritis initially affects the smooth cartilage lining of the joint. This makes movement more difficult than usual, leading to pain and stiffness. Once the cartilage lining starts to roughen and thin out, the tendons and ligaments have to work harder. This can cause swelling and the formation of bony spurs, called osteophytes. Severe loss of cartilage can lead to bone rubbing on bone, altering the shape of the joint and forcing the bones out of their normal position. The most commonly affected joints\u00a0are those in the: hands spine knees hips Rheumatoid arthritis In the UK, rheumatoid arthritis affects more than 400,000 people. It often starts when a person is between 40 and 50 years old. Women are three times more likely to be affected than men. Rheumatoid and osteoarthritis are two different conditions. Rheumatoid arthritis occurs when the body's immune system targets affected joints, which leads to pain and swelling.\u00a0 The outer covering (synovium) of the joint is the first place affected. This can then spread across the joint, leading to further swelling and a change in the joint's shape. This\u00a0may cause the\u00a0bone and cartilage to break down. People with rheumatoid arthritis can also develop problems with other tissues and organs in their body.\u00a0 Other types of arthritis and related conditions Ankylosing spondylitis\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a long-term inflammatory\u00a0condition that mainly affects the bones, muscles and ligaments of the spine, leading to stiffness and joints fusing together.\u00a0Other problems can include the swelling of tendons, eyes and large joints. Cervical\u00a0spondylosis\u00a0\u2013\u00a0also known as degenerative osteoarthritis, cervical spondylitis affects the joints and bones in the neck, which can lead to pain and stiffness. Fibromyalgia\u00a0\u2013\u00a0causes pain in the body's muscles, ligaments and tendons. Lupus\u00a0\u2013\u00a0an autoimmune condition that can affect many different organs and the body's tissues. Gout\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a type of arthritis caused by too much uric acid in the body. This can be left in joints (usually affecting the big toe) but can develop in any joint. It causes intense pain, redness\u00a0and swelling. Psoriatic arthritis\u00a0\u2013\u00a0an inflammatory joint condition that can affect people with\u00a0psoriasis. Enteropathic arthritis\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a form of chronic, inflammatory arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the two best-known types being ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. About one in\u00a0five people with Crohn's or ulcerative colitis will develop enteropathic arthritis. The most common areas affected by inflammation are\u00a0the peripheral (limb) joints and the spine. Reactive arthritis\u00a0\u2013\u00a0this can cause inflammation of the joints, eyes and urethra (the tube that urine passes through).\u00a0It develops shortly after an infection of the bowel, genital tract or, less frequently, after a throat infection. Secondary arthritis\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a type of arthritis that can develop after a joint injury and sometimes occurs many years afterwards. Polymyalgia rheumatica\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a condition that almost always affects people over 50 years of age, where the immune system causes muscle pain and\u00a0stiffness, usually across the shoulders and tops of the legs. It can also cause\u00a0joint inflammation. Symptoms of arthritis The\u00a0symptoms of arthritis you experience will vary depending on the type you have. This is why it's important to have an accurate diagnosis if you have: joint pain, tenderness and stiffness inflammation in and around the joints restricted movement of the\u00a0joints warm, red skin over the affected joint weakness and\u00a0muscle wasting Arthritis and children Arthritis is often associated with older people, but\u00a0it can also\u00a0affect children. In the UK, about 15,000 children and young people are affected by arthritis. Most types of childhood arthritis are known as juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). JIA causes pain and\u00a0inflammation in one or more joints for at least six weeks. Although the exact cause of JIA is\u00a0unknown, the symptoms often improve as a child gets older, meaning they can lead a normal life. The main types of JIA are discussed below. Arthritis Research UK has more information about the different types of juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Oligo-articular JIA Oligo-articular JIA is the most common type of JIA. It affects fewer than five joints in the body\u00a0\u2013\u00a0most commonly in the knees, ankles and wrists. Oligo-articular JIA has good recovery rates and long-term effects are rare. However, there's a risk that children\u00a0with the condition may develop eye problems, so regular\u00a0eye\u00a0tests with an ophthalmologist (eye care specialist) are recommended. Polyarticular JIA (polyarthritis) Polyarticular JIA, or polyarthritis, affects five or more joints. It can develop at any age during childhood. The symptoms of polyarticular JIA are similar to the symptoms of adult rheumatoid arthritis. The condition is often accompanied by a rash and a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above. Systemic onset JIA Systemic onset JIA begins with symptoms such as a fever, rash, lethargy (a lack of energy) and enlarged glands. Later on, joints can\u00a0become swollen and inflamed. Like polyarticular JIA, systemic onset JIA can affect children of any age. Enthesitis-related arthritis Enthesitis-related arthritis is a type of juvenile arthritis that affects older boys or teenagers. It can cause pain in the soles of the feet and around the knee and hip joints, where the ligaments attach to the bone. Treating arthritis There's no cure for arthritis, but there are many treatments that can help slow down the condition. For osteoarthritis, medications are often prescribed, including: painkillers non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) corticosteroids In severe cases, the following surgical procedures may be recommended: arthroplasty (joint replacement) arthodesis (joint fusion) osteotomy (where a\u00a0bone is cut and re-aligned) Read more\u00a0about\u00a0how osteoarthritis is treated. Treatment for\u00a0rheumatoid arthritis aims\u00a0to slow down the condition's progress and minimise joint inflammation or swelling. This is\u00a0to try and prevent damage to the joints. Recommended treatments include: analgesics (painkillers) disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a combination of treatments is often recommended physiotherapy\u00a0 regular exercise\u00a0 Read more\u00a0about\u00a0how rheumatoid arthritis\u00a0is treated.

Your GP will usually be able to diagnose asthma by asking about your or your child's symptoms and carrying out some simple breathing tests. But these are often difficult to do in infants and young children, so the diagnosis may be made on the basis of symptoms and response to a trial of treatment with an inhaler. Read more about\u00a0how asthma is diagnosed. Causes\u00a0of asthma Asthma is caused by inflammation (swelling) of the breathing tubes that carry air in and out of the lungs. This inflammation makes the breathing tubes highly sensitive, so they temporarily become narrow. This may occur randomly, or after exposure to a trigger. The tubes may also sometimes become clogged with sticky mucus. Common asthma triggers include: allergens, such as house dust mites, animal fur and pollens other irritants, such as cigarette smoke, strong smells, gases and cold air exercise chest infections The reason why some people develop asthma isn't fully understood, although it's known that you're more likely to develop it if you have a close relative with the condition. Read more about the causes of asthma. \u00a0 Treatments\u00a0for asthma While there's currently no cure for asthma, there are a number of treatments that can help control the condition. Most asthma treatments are taken using an inhaler, a small device that delivers a spray or powder medicine to your breathing tubes as you breathe in. The main treatments are: identifying and avoiding asthma triggers if possible reliever inhalers \u2013 inhalers used when needed to quickly relieve asthma symptoms for a short time preventer inhalers \u2013 inhalers used regularly every day to reduce the inflammation in the breathing tubes, which prevents asthma symptoms occurring You'll usually draw up a\u00a0personal action plan\u00a0with your doctor or asthma nurse.

It may be triggered by bad posture while sitting or standing, bending awkwardly, or lifting incorrectly. It's not generally caused by a serious condition. Find out more about the\u00a0causes of back pain. In most cases back pain will improve in a few weeks or months, although some people experience long-term pain or pain that keeps coming back. Types of back pain Backache is most common in the lower back (lumbago), although it can be felt anywhere along your spine, from your neck down to your hips. Read information on\u00a0neck pain and\u00a0shoulder pain, which are covered separately. Sometimes back pain can be caused by an injury or disease, such as: a\u00a0slipped disc \u2013 when one of the discs in the spine is damaged and presses on the nerves sciatica \u2013 irritation or compression of the sciatic nerve, which causes pain, numbness and tingling that travels down one\u00a0leg whiplash\u00a0\u2013 neck injury caused by a sudden impact frozen shoulder\u00a0\u2013 inflammation around the shoulder that causes pain and stiffness ankylosing spondylitis\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a long-term condition that causes pain and stiffness where the spine meets the pelvis The rest of this information will focus on back pain that doesn't have an obvious cause. Doctors call this non-specific back pain. What to do Most cases of back pain get better on their own and you may not need to see a doctor. If you've only had back pain for a few days or weeks, the following advice may help relieve your symptoms and speed up your recovery: remain as active as possible and try to continue with your daily activities take over-the-counter painkillers such as\u00a0paracetamol or ibuprofen if you feel you need to use hot or cold compression packs \u2013 you can buy these from your local pharmacy, or a bag of frozen vegetables and a hot water bottle will work just as well Although it can be difficult to be cheerful or optimistic if you are in pain, it's important to stay positive as this can help you recover faster. Read more about treatments for short-term back pain. Treatments for long-term back pain If you're worried about your back or your pain hasn't improved by around six weeks, it's a good idea to visit your GP, who can advise you about the treatments available. These include: stronger painkillers exercise classes \u2013 where you are taught specific exercises to strengthen your muscles and improve your posture manual therapy\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as\u00a0physiotherapy, chiropractic or osteopathy acupuncture counselling\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as\u00a0cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) support and advice at a specialist pain clinic Some people choose to see a therapist for manual therapy or acupuncture without seeing their GP first. If you want to do this, you will usually need to pay for private treatment, which is likely to cost around \u00a330-50 for each appointment. Spinal surgery is usually only recommended when all else has failed. Read more about treating long-term back pain. Preventing back pain How you sit, stand, lie and lift can all affect the health of your back. Try to avoid placing too much pressure on your back and ensure it's strong and supple. Regular exercise, such as walking and swimming, is an excellent way of preventing back pain. Activities such as yoga or pilates can improve your flexibility and strengthen your back muscles. See the back pain guide for advice about how to sit, stand and lift correctly to avoid backache, or read more about preventing back pain.

Most women\u00a0diagnosed with breast cancer\u00a0are over 50, but younger women can also\u00a0get breast cancer. About\u00a0one in eight\u00a0women are diagnosed with\u00a0breast cancer during their lifetime. There's a good chance of recovery if it's detected in its early stages. For this reason, it's vital that women check their breasts regularly for any changes and always get any changes examined by their GP. In rare cases, men can also be diagnosed with breast cancer. Read about breast cancer\u00a0in men. This topic covers: Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Types of breast cancer Breast cancer screening Treatment Living with breast cancer Prevention Symptoms of breast cancer Breast cancer can have a number of symptoms, but the first noticeable symptom is usually a lump or area of thickened breast tissue. Most breast lumps aren't cancerous, but it's always best to have them checked by your doctor. You should also see your GP if you notice any of the following: a change in the size or shape of one or both breasts discharge from either of your nipples, which may be streaked with blood a lump or swelling in either of your armpits dimpling on the skin of your breasts a rash on or around your nipple a change in the appearance of your nipple, such as becoming sunken into your breast Breast pain is not a symptom of breast cancer. Read more about the symptoms of breast cancer. Causes of breast cancer The exact causes of breast cancer aren't fully understood. However, there are certain factors known to increase the risk\u00a0of breast cancer. These include: age\u00a0\u2013 the risk increases as you get older a family history of breast cancer a previous diagnosis of\u00a0breast cancer a previous benign breast lump being tall, overweight or obese excessive use of alcohol Read more about the causes of breast cancer. Diagnosing breast cancer After examining your breasts, your GP may refer you to a specialist breast cancer clinic for further tests.\u00a0This might include breast screening (mammography)\u00a0or a biopsy. Read about\u00a0how breast cancer is diagnosed. Types of breast cancer There are several different types of breast cancer, which can develop in different parts of the breast. Breast cancer is often divided into: non-invasive breast cancer (carcinoma in situ)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0found in the ducts of the breast (ductal carcinoma in situ, DCIS) and hasn't developed the ability to spread outside the breast. It's usually found during a mammogram and rarely shows as a breast lump. invasive breast cancer \u2013 usually develops in the cells that line the breast ducts (invasive ductal breast cancer) and is the most common type of breast cancer. It can spread outside the breast, although this doesn't necessarily mean it has spread. Other less common types of breast cancer include: invasive (and pre-invasive) lobular breast cancer inflammatory breast cancer Paget's disease of the breast It's possible for breast cancer to spread to other parts of the body, usually through the bloodstream or the axillary lymph nodes. These\u00a0are small lymphatic glands that filter bacteria and cells from the mammary gland. If this happens, it's known as secondary, or metastatic, breast cancer. Breast cancer screening Mammographic screening, where X-ray images of the breast are taken, is the most commonly available method of detecting an early breast lesion. However, you should be aware that a mammogram might fail to detect some breast cancers. It might also increase your chances of having extra tests and interventions, including surgery, even if you're not affected by breast cancer. Women with a higher-than-average risk of developing breast cancer may be offered screening and genetic testing for the condition. As the risk of breast cancer increases with age, all women who are 50 to 70 years old are invited for breast cancer screening every three years. Women over the age of\u00a070 are also entitled to screening and can arrange an appointment through their GP or local screening unit. The NHS is in the process of extending the programme as a trial, offering screening to some women aged 47 to 73. Read about\u00a0breast screening. Find\u00a0breast cancer screening services near you. Treating breast cancer If cancer is detected at an early stage, it can be treated before it spreads to nearby parts of the body. Breast cancer is treated using a combination of: surgery chemotherapy radiotherapy Surgery is usually the first type of treatment you'll have, followed by chemotherapy or radiotherapy or, in some cases, hormone or biological treatments. The type of surgery and the treatment you have afterwards will depend on the type of breast cancer you have. Your doctor will discuss the best treatment plan with you. In a\u00a0small proportion of women, breast cancer is discovered after it's spread to other parts of the body (metastatic breast cancer). Secondary cancer, also called advanced or metastatic cancer, isn't curable, so the aim of treatment is\u00a0to\u00a0achieve remission (symptom relief). Read about treating breast cancer. Living with breast cancer Being diagnosed with breast cancer can affect daily life in many ways, depending on what stage\u00a0it's at and\u00a0the treatment you're having. How women cope with their diagnosis and treatment varies from person to person. You can be reassured that there are several forms of support available, if you need it. For example: your\u00a0family and\u00a0friends can be a powerful support system you can communicate with other people in the same situation find out as much as possible about your condition don't try to do too much or overexert yourself make time for yourself Read about living with breast cancer. Preventing breast cancer As the causes of breast cancer aren't fully understood, at the moment it's not possible to know if it can be prevented. If you're at increased risk of developing the condition, some treatments are available to reduce the risk. Studies have looked at the link between breast cancer and diet. Although there are no definite conclusions, there are benefits for women who: maintain a healthy weight exercise regularly have a low intake of saturated\u00a0fat and alcohol It's been suggested that regular exercise can reduce your risk of breast cancer by as much as a third. Regular exercise and a healthy lifestyle can also improve the outlook for people affected by\u00a0breast cancer.\u00a0 If you've been through the menopause, it's particularly important that you're not overweight or obese. This is because being overweight or obese causes more oestrogen to be produced, which can increase the risk of breast cancer. Read about preventing breast cancer.

There are\u00a0two main types of diabetes: type 1 diabetes \u2013 where\u00a0the body's immune system attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin type 2 diabetes\u00a0\u2013\u00a0where the body doesn't produce enough insulin, or the body's cells don't react to insulin Type 2 diabetes is far more common than type 1. In\u00a0the UK,\u00a0around 90% of all adults\u00a0with diabetes have type 2. During pregnancy, some women have such high levels of blood glucose that their body is unable to\u00a0produce enough insulin to absorb it all. This is known as\u00a0gestational diabetes. Pre-diabetes Many more people have blood sugar levels above the normal range, but not high enough to be diagnosed as having diabetes. This is sometimes known as pre-diabetes. If\u00a0your blood sugar level is above the normal range, your risk of developing full-blown diabetes is increased. It's very important for diabetes to be diagnosed as early as possible because it will get progressively worse if left untreated. When to see a doctor Visit your GP as soon as possible if you experience the main symptoms of diabetes, which include: feeling very\u00a0thirsty urinating more frequently than usual, particularly at night feeling very tired weight loss and loss of muscle bulk itching around the penis or vagina, or frequent episodes of thrush cuts or wounds that heal slowly blurred vision Type 1 diabetes can develop quickly over weeks or even days. Many people have type 2 diabetes for years without realising because the early symptoms tend to be general.

Causes\u00a0of diabetes The amount of sugar in the blood is controlled by a hormone called insulin, which is produced by the pancreas (a gland behind the stomach). When food is digested and enters your bloodstream, insulin moves glucose out of the blood and into cells, where it's broken down to produce energy. However,\u00a0if you have\u00a0diabetes, your\u00a0body is unable to break down glucose into energy. This is because there's either not enough insulin to move the glucose, or the insulin produced doesn't work properly. Although there are no lifestyle changes you can make to lower your risk of type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes is often linked to being overweight. Read about how to reduce your diabetes risk. Living with diabetes If you're diagnosed with diabetes, you'll need to\u00a0eat healthily, take regular exercise\u00a0and carry out regular blood tests\u00a0to ensure your blood glucose levels stay balanced. You can use the\u00a0BMI healthy weight calculator to check whether you're a healthy\u00a0weight. People diagnosed with type 1 diabetes also require regular\u00a0insulin injections for the rest of their life. As type 2 diabetes is a progressive condition, medication may eventually be required, usually in the form of tablets. Read about:\u00a0 Treating type 1 diabetes Treating type 2 diabetes Living with diabetes Diabetic eye screening Everyone with diabetes aged 12 or over should be invited to have their eyes screened once a year. If you have diabetes, your eyes are at risk from diabetic retinopathy, a condition that can lead to sight loss if it's not treated. Screening, which involves\u00a0a half-hour check to examine the back of the eyes,\u00a0is a way of detecting the condition early so it can be treated more effectively.
